In this game, the user controls a red dot and is tasked with following the green dot as closely as possible.

There are three modes in this game. The game will suddenly switch from one mode to the next and the user needs to learn and adjust to the change
as quickly as possible.

The first mode is "normal". Normal mouse/trackpad/etc. movements will translate to the expected movements of the red dot. In the other modes, 
this is not necessarily so.

Do note, that your data (the questions you answer before the game and where your red dot is) is collected and saved.
